## PROJECTS

● Ray-tracing ([link](https://github.com/Magorx/zeta_path_tracer))  
Implemented a 3D scene renderer using path-tracing technology with BVH optimization (Bounding Volume
Hierarchies). Supports movable camera, antialiasing, reflections, refractions with Schlick approximation,
global-like lightning, custom triangulated models; different materials, primitives, textures, and light emitters
can be combined easily. Multithreading and map-reduce can be used for faster render. (C++)  
● Virtual CPU ([link](https://github.com/Magorx/SPU))  
Developed a CPU emulator with a custom assembler language. A program written in this assembler is
transformed to a binary “executable” which is executed by the CPU emulator. (C, Assembler)  
● C-like programming language ([link](https://github.com/Magorx/microContextCompiler))  
Designed a programming language and developed a compiler into Virtual CPU assembler and x86 machine
commands (with elf-file creation) for it. Supports arithmetic operations, variables, constants, functions with
default parameters, loops, arrays, symbolic graphics, and dynamic memory. (C++, Assembler)  
● Teach-yourself Telegram bot for SAT in Russia ([link](https://github.com/Magorx/egeshnik))  
Implemented a telegram bot aimed at helping students of my school to prepare for the final unified State
Exam, up to 15 users simultaneously online and 50unique users during all time.
(Python, Telegram API)  
● PingPonger - a life safety platform ([link](https://github.com/Magorx/NOU))  
Developed a prototype of a platform aimed to passively increase life safety during periods of predictably
high danger. Took second place in the XXIX Annual "Sakharov’s Readings" (2019, link) — The High School
Conference in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Python)
